# Screenshot Placeholder

This file represents where a theme screenshot would be placed (screenshot.png).
In a real WordPress theme, this would be a 1200x900 pixel PNG image showing the theme design.

For now, you can create a screenshot of the homepage and save it as screenshot.png in the theme folder.
